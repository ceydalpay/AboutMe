    <hr>
    <p>My name is Ceyda Alpay. I am a 4th year Computer Enigneering student in Ankara Y覺ld覺r覺m Beyaz覺t University, and my CGPA is 3,46.
    Right now, I am a Technology Intern at Modanisa. I am in Homepage Team and I am currently developing some full-stack projects
    by using Vue.js, Golang, Nuxt, and Tailwind CSS. This is my volunteer internship. I did my first compulsory summer internship at Aselsan last summer. Although the places where I did my internship are doing business on different subjects, I want to work on branches such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science after I graduate. I have a particular interest in Natural Language Processing and I am doing research on this subject and I am planning to deal with this subject in my master's degree.
