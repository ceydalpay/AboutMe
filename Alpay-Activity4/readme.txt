I uploaded my code to the website and link is "https://ceydalpay.github.io/AboutMe/Alpay-Activity4/activity4.php"

But since GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesnâ€™t support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python,
when you go to the link, php code doesn't run instead it is downloaded automatically. So the website doesn't work.
